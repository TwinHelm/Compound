# Compound
Compound is a generative modular typeface, combining the concept of using geometric shapes within type design alongside the use of programming in typography. The inspiration of the design stems from the grid-based typographic works of graphic designer - Jurriaan Schrofer - notable for producing an array of geometric alphabets. 

Compound has been created with the use of [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/) and [p5.js-svg](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg).
