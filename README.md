# Compound
Compound is a generative modular typeface, combining the concept of using geometric shapes within type design alongside the use of programming in typography. The inspiration of the design stems from the grid-based typographic works of graphic designer - Jurriaan Schrofer - notable for producing an array of geometric alphabets. 

Note that this has been created with the intention to be used as a display typeface. Therefore it is suitable at a large size such as a heading or title, rather than used for long amounts of text.

Compound has been created with the use of [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/) and [p5.js-svg](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg).


## How to use this typeface

This typeface is currently hosted online with a web based interface, with an option to export the output as an SVG. Due to its generative nature, Compound can be adapted from its default values to better suit its user's needs.

## Will Compound be released as a font file?

Since this project has been developed as an exploration of generative typography, it is not currently under consideration to be developed into a font file format.
